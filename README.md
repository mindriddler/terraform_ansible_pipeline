## Overview

As part of our DevOps Engineer education we was tasked with creating a project that would automaticly move changes from dev environment to production environment. We decided to create a pipeline that would create a VM in GCP and then install a webserver on it. The pipeline would be triggered by a merge to the staging branch.

## Prerequisites

* A working installation of Terraform
* A working installation of Ansible
* A GCP account
