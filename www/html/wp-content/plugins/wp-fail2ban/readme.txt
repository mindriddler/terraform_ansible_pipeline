*WP fail2ban* uses `fail2ban` to protect your WordPress site.

== Description ==

[fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-premium-5.2.0) is one of the simplest and most effective security measures you can implement to protect your WordPress site.

*WP fail2ban* provides the link between WordPress and `fail2ban`:

    Oct 17 20:59:54 foobar wordpress(www.example.com)[1234]: Authentication failure for admin from 192.168.0.1
    Oct 17 21:00:00 foobar wordpress(www.example.com)[2345]: Accepted password for admin from 192.168.0.1

*WPf2b* comes with three `fail2ban` filters: `wordpress-hard.conf`, `wordpress-soft.conf`, and `wordpress-extra.conf`. These are designed to allow a split between immediate banning (hard) and the traditional more graceful approach (soft), with extra rules for custom configurations.

= Features =

* **Failed Login Attempts**
  The very first feature of *WPf2b*: logging failed login attempts so the IP can be banned. Just as useful today as it was then.
  
* **Block User Enumeration**
  One of the most common precursors to a password-guessing brute force attack is [user enumeration](https://wp-fail2ban.com/features/block-user-enumeration/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-premium-5.2.0). *WPf2b* can block it, stopping the attack before it starts.

* **Block username logins**
  Sometimes it's not possible to block user enumeration (for example, if your theme provides Author profiles). *WPf2b* can require users to login with their email address instead of their username.

* **Blocking Users**
  Anther of the older *WPf2b* features: the login process can be aborted for specified usernames.
  Say a bot collected your site's usernames before you blocked user enumeration. Once you’ve changed all the usernames, add the old ones to the list; anything using them will trigger a "hard" fail.

* **Empty Username Login Attempts**
  Some bots will try to login without a username; harmless, but annoying. These attempts are logged as a "soft" fail so the more persistent bots will be banned.

* **Spam**
  *WPf2b* will log a spammer's IP address as a "hard" fail when their comment is marked as spam; the Premium version will also log the IP when Akismet discards "obvious" spam.

* **Attempted Comments**
  Some spam bots try to comment on everything, even things that aren't there. *WPf2b* detects these and logs them as a "hard" fail.

* **Pingbacks**
  Pingbacks are a great feature, but they can be abused to attack the rest of the WWW. Rather than disable them completely, *WPf2b* effectively rate-limits potential attackers by logging the IP address as a "soft" fail.

* **Block XML‑RPC Requests** [Premium]
  The only reason most sites need XML‑RPC (other than Pingbacks) is for Jetpack; *WPf2b* Premium can block XML‑RPC while allowing Jetpack and/or Pingbacks.

* **Block Countries** [Premium]
  Sometimes you just need a bigger hammer - if you’re seeing nothing but attacks from some countries, block them!

* **Cloudflare and Proxy Servers**
  *WPf2b* will work with [Cloudflare](https://wp-fail2ban.com/features/cloudflare-and-proxy-servers/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-premium-5.2.0), and the Premium version will automatically update the list of Cloudflare IP addresses.
  You can also configure your own list of trusted proxies.

* **syslog Dashboard Widget**
  Ever wondered what's being logged? The dashboard widget shows the last 5 messages; the Premium version keeps a full history to help you analyse and prevent attacks.

* **Site Health Check**
  *WPf2b* will (try to) check that your `fail2ban` configuration is sane and that the filters are up to date; out-of-date filters are the primary cause of *WPf2b* not working as well as it can.
  When did you last run the Site Health tool?

* **`mu-plugins` Support**
  *WPf2b* can easily be configured as a "must-use plugin" - see [Configuration](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/5.2/configuration.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-premium-5.2.0#mu-plugins-support).

* **API to Extend *WPf2b***
  If your plugin can detect behaviour which should be blocked, why reinvent the wheel?

* **Event Hooks** [Premium]
  Need to do something special when *WPf2b* detects a particular event? [There's a hook for that](https://docs.wp-fail2ban.com/en/5.2/developers/events.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wp-fail2ban-premium-5.2.0).
